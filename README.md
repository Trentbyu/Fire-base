# Overview


This program allows a user to create their own account using their email and password. The user can then go and save infomation to the data base 
The data base accepts user information tables which allow the user to store their data about their first and last name as well as their address. The user is able to create their own collections of data and store what they want to. The user can store files on the firebase storage. The user can also uplaod to the realtime database as well.

# Cloud Database


I created a firebase database.Firebase is a set of hosting services for any type of application. It offers NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases, content, social authentication, and notifications, or services, such as a real-time communication server <br> <br> 
{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}ed three diffrent cloud structures Real time data base, firestore data base and a cloud storage data base.
# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
