# Overview

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database.  Describe how to use your program.}
This program allows a user to create their own account using their email and password. The user can then go and save infomation to the data base 
The data base accepts user information tables which allow the user to store their data about their first and last name as well as their address. The user is able to create their own collections of data and store what they want to. The user can store files on the firebase storage. The user can also uplaod to the realtime database as well. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I created this softwarwe to better understand firebase. By learning firebase i have a better understanding on how backened severices work on apps and websites. This software helps improve my ability to work on and with cloud data bases. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}
I created a firebase database.
{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
I created three diffrent cloud structures Real time data base, firestore data base and a cloud storage data base.
# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
In this software i used Pyhton. Inside of python i used pyrebase and firebase_admin modules from firebase to be able to upload data and query it from pyhton.
